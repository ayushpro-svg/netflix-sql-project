# 📺 Netflix SQL Journey
Welcome to my Netflix SQL Project! 📽️

This project showcases my journey from beginner to advanced SQL using the Netflix dataset (`netflix_titles`). It’s a five-level deep dive into querying, analysis, and database wizardry, all done with MySQL.

My Netflix SQL exploration — from basics to boss level.  
This repo covers:
- 🟢 Level 1: Basic SELECTs
- 🟡 Level 2–4: Filtering, Grouping, Dates
- 🔴 Level 5: Advanced logic, case, subqueries

> Built using MySQL on the `netflix_titles.csv` dataset.
